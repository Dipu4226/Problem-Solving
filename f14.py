# Question 14
# Level 2

# Question:
# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# Hello world!
# Then, the output should be:
# UPPER CASE 1
# LOWER CASE 9

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# #----------------------------------------#


# ord() function convert characte to equivalent int code    /// it only accept character not string

# chr() mrthod will convert int to char         ///  it only accept int not string
 





# string = input("Enter = ")
# upper = 0
# lower = 0

# for i in string:
#     if ord(i) in range(65,90+1):
#           upper += 1
#     elif ord(i) in range(97,122+1):
#          lower +=1
#     else:
#          continue

# print("Upper charater is ", upper)
# print("Lower is ", lower)
