# Question£º
# Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# Hello world
# Practice makes perfect
# Then, the output should be:
# HELLO WORLD
# PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

# Initialize an empty list to hold the lines
# lines = []

# print("Enter lines of text (press Enter on a blank line to finish):")

# while True:
#     line = input()  # Read a line of input
#     if line:  # If the line is not empty
#         lines.append(line)  # Add it to the list
#     else:
#         break  # Exit the loop on a blank line

# # Convert each line to uppercase
# capitalized_lines = [line.upper() for line in lines]

# # Print the result
# for capitalized_line in capitalized_lines:
#     print(capitalized_line)
