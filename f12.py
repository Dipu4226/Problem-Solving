# Question 12
# Level 2

# Question:
# Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# c = []

# for i in range(1000,3000+1):
#     even=True
#     number = i
    
#     for _ in range(4):
#         lastdigit = number % 10
#         if lastdigit%2 != 0:
#             even = False
#             break
#         number = number//10
    
#     if even:
#         c.append(str(i))


# result  = ",".join(c)
# print(result)
